# Macintosh Color Classic Mystic Back Panel (No-Customizations)

This is a stock back panel for a Macintosh Color Classic (Mystic) with the LC575 modification. 

There are 2 folders
- single
- layers

single
- contains the model as a single printable piece

layers
- contains the model as different layers that is printed in pieces and put together in an attempt to preserve details.
- I printed the bottom layer with a 0.2mm nozzle to maintain the details in the icons, and the remaining layers I printed using a 0.4mm nozzle.
- I plastic welded the pieces together, but glue would work just the same.
