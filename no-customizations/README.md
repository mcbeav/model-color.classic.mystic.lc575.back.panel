# Macintosh Color Classic Mystic Back Panel (No-Customizations)

  

This is a stock back panel for a Macintosh Color Classic (Mystic) with the LC575 modification. This revision of models has removed any customizations, and has standard style expansion ports.

There are 4 different folders containing different model revisions.

 - **expansion-ports**
	 - has the standard PDS & Comm ports open and has printable covers if the either expansion port is not populated.
 - **no-expansion-ports**
	 - removes both expansion ports if you dont plan on populating either PDS or Comm expansion ports
 - **no-comm-port**
	 - removes the Comm expansion port if you don't plan on populating the Comm expansion port
		 - comes with a printable cover for the PDS expansion port
 - **no-pds-port**
	 - removes the PDS expansion port if you don't plan on populating the PDS expansion port
		 - comes with a printable cover for the Comm expansion port

Each mode has 2 folders

-  **single**

-  **layers**

  

### single

  

- contains the model as a single printable piece

  
  

### layers

  

- contains the model as different layers that is printed in pieces and put together in an attempt to preserve details.

- I printed the bottom layer with a 0.2mm nozzle to maintain the details in the icons, and the remaining layers I printed using a 0.4mm nozzle.

- I plastic welded the pieces together, but glue would work just the same.
