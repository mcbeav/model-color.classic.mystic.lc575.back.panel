# Macintosh Color Classic Mystic Back Panel (All-Customizations)

  

This contains models for custom back panels for a Macintosh Color Classic Mystic (LC575) modification.

There are 3 folders each containing a different model.

 - **all-customizations**
 - **flippyfloppy-revision**
 - **standard-expansion-ports**

### All Customizations

 - This is my custom back panel that contains all of the custom modifications for my personal Color Classic Mystic.
 - It is unlikely this model will be useful for you because of the specific modifications.

#### Customizations

 - SD card slot for internal BlueSCSI
	 - requires an SD card extension cable
 - PDS slot is modified to perfectly fit the Apple IIe card
 - PCI slot is modified to fit an Apple Ethernet expansion card, and the opening is in the shape of an RJ45 plug
 - There is a custom hole above the DB25/SCSI connector for a modified FlippyFloppy
	 - The mount for the FlippyFloppy switch is located above the serial port.
	 - A custom janky pcb was wired to adapt the IDC20 cable the FlippyFloppy ships with, to use a rewired DB19 cable from an Apple Floppy Disk Drive.
		 - This adapter required a mount which is found in the db19-mount directory

### FlippyFloppy Revision

- I revised my personal model to support the standard IDC20 ribbon cable connector the FlippyFloppy ships with.
- This has the same customizations as my personal back panel except it should be more useful for most.
	- *I removed a small hole that was meant to access a Spicy O' Clock from KayKoba, but this also required a custom bracket that is not uploaded. There is no noticeable difference.*

#### Customizations

 - SD card slot for internal BlueSCSI
	 - requires an SD card extension cable
 - PDS slot is modified to perfectly fit the Apple IIe card
 - PCI slot is modified to fit an Apple Ethernet expansion card, and the opening is in the shape of an RJ45 plug
 - FlippyFloppy support

### Standard Expansion Ports

- I revised the model again to have the more standard style expansion ports
- They include port covers that can be printed if you don't have a use for 1 or both expansion ports

#### Customizations

 - SD card slot for internal BlueSCSI
	 - requires an SD card extension cable
 - FlippyFloppy Support

## Important

There are 2 folders for each model

-  **single**

-  **layers**

  

### single

  

- contains the model as a single printable piece

  
  

### layers

  

- contains the model as different layers that is printed in pieces and put together in an attempt to preserve details.

- I printed the bottom layer with a 0.2mm nozzle to maintain the details in the icons, and the remaining layers I printed using a 0.4mm nozzle.

- I plastic welded the pieces together, but glue would work just the same.
