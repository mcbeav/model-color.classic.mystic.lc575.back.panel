# Macintosh Color Classic Mystic LC575 Custom Back Panel Model

This repository contains models with different options for a custom back panel for the Macintosh Color Classic with the LC575 (Mystic) upgrade. 

***I'll be pushing new configurations and options for the back panel, but I am uploading what I have available at the moment.***

### Preface
I was not happy with the tolerances and options with existing models for a back panel for a Macintosh Color Classic Mystic, so I designed a new one. I added icons to describe each port, a spot for an SD card slot for my internal BlueSCSI with an SD card extension, FloppyEMU support with a custom bracket, so I could plug in the FloppyEMU using a DB19 cable, and changed the expansion slots to specifically fit my Apple IIe card, and an Apple Ethernet card.

*I am NOT an engineer, nor do I have much experience with 3D modelling. These models fit my Color Classic Mystic perfect, but I can not guarantee they will fit yours perfectly.*

*My original model has very specific customizations that will likely not be helpful for you, so I am making some revisions and uploading a few more options. The model is also open source, so you can modify it to fit your needs.*

## Notes

For each model there are 2 folders containing models. 

The model as a single object, and the model split into pieces. 

The single object model can be printed as is.

The model split into different pieces, is printed in 4 different pieces and put together. I printed the bottom layer using a 0.2mm nozzle to preserve the details in the icons on the back panel. The inner layer and the inserts I printed using a standard 0.4mm nozzle. Everything fits together, and I plastic welded the pieces together, however glue would work just fine. 

This repository is a little confusing, so I'll do my best to explain.
